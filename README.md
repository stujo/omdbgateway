# omdbgateway

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/omdbgateway.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/omdbgateway)

OMDBGateway is not a supported Gem at this time

It is a faraday rewrite of [Casey Scarborough's omdbapi](https://github.com/caseyscarborough/omdbapi)

Not that there's anything wrong with what he did, I just wanted to try faraday and we're using OMDB
in our class
